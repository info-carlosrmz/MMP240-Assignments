<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Coconut Curry Chickpeas With Pumpkin and Lime</h3>
<h4>By Melissa Clark</h4>
<h4>Total Time: 30 minutes</h4>
<p>Canned pumpkin purée and coconut milk, heavily seasoned with curry spices and lots of fresh lime juice, make a sweet-sharp sauce for chickpeas. It’s a rich, creamy curry that you can eat on its own, or serve over rice or couscous. If you want to incorporate more vegetables, stir in some spinach, baby kale or sliced green beans during the last few minutes of cooking, letting them soften in the sauce.</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Stir in chickpeas, coconut milk, pumpkin, ½ cup water and 1½ teaspoons salt. Bring to a simmer and continue to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to let the flavors meld.

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Serve over rice or couscous if you like, and top with more cilantro and lime wedges on the side.</p>
